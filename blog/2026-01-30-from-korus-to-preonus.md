# From Korus to Preonus: The Story Behind Our Name

Today, I'm excited to share the story of our framework's evolution—not just in code, but in identity. What began as **Korus** has transformed into **Preonus**, a name that better reflects our mission and philosophy.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why the Change?

As the framework matured, it became clear that we needed a name that captured its fundamental nature: breaking down complexity to its most basic, powerful elements. We wanted something that embodied the idea of **fundamental building blocks**—the foundation upon which everything else is constructed.

That's when we discovered the perfect fit: **Preonus**.

## The Meaning Behind Preonus

**Preonus** is a portmanteau with deep scientific and linguistic roots:

### **Preon** — The Ultimate Building Block

In particle physics, **preons** are hypothetical subatomic, point-like particles proposed in the 1970s as the fundamental constituents of quarks and leptons. While quarks and leptons were once considered the most basic particles, preon theory suggests there might be an even deeper layer—an ultimate foundation from which everything is built.

This perfectly mirrors our framework's philosophy:

- **Fundamental** — Everything reduces to the simplest, most essential components
- **Point-like precision** — No bloat, no unnecessary abstraction
- **Building blocks** — The foundation upon which complex systems are constructed
- **Compile-time over runtime** — Resolve everything at the deepest level, before execution

Just as preons (if they exist) would be the ultimate constituents of matter, Preonus aims to be the ultimate foundation for Java applications—stripped down to pure compile-time logic with zero runtime magic.

### **Us** — Together in Purpose

The suffix **"us"** comes from Latin, often denoting:

- **Collective unity** — A framework that brings components together
- **Belonging** — A community of developers building with the same philosophy
- **Plurality** — Many parts working as one cohesive whole

In Latin grammar, "-us" is a common noun ending that conveys substance and completeness. Combined with "Preon," it creates a name that feels both scientific and human.

## The Philosophy Lives On

At its core, Preonus is about:

- **Fundamentals first** — Build on the strongest possible foundation
- **Compile-time everything** — Resolve complexity before runtime
- **Zero magic** — Transparent, deterministic behavior
- **Maximum performance** — Remove every unnecessary layer

The name **Preonus** embodies this perfectly. It's a framework built on the idea that **great software starts with fundamental building blocks**, assembled with precision at compile time.
